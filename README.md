# Machine_Learning_2022

Theses exercises are a series of Python related tasks intended to help learn python from its roots, I will be submitting all the tasks I've got to do in this course from Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/mlmasterclass/).

The order of this exercises will correlate to the course indeed; I'll try to keep my code written on English as much as possible.

## How To Use These Exercises 

1. Fork and clone this repository. To learn how to fork a repository, see the GitHub documentation on how to [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). 
    * Copies of repositories on your machine are called clones. If you need help cloning to your local environment you can learn how from the GitHub documentation on [cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
2. Go to an exercise directory and open the project file in your Python IDE/Terminal/Code Editor. You can either open the file directly on a text editor like Notepad++, or use something like VSCode.
2.1. If You really want to use the terminal keep in mind you got to execute the command "python" and then the name of your .py file from the directory you're within (including the route of course).
3. Do not submit your solutions to this repo, as any PRs that do so will be closed without merging.
